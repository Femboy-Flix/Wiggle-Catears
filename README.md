# Wiggle-Catears
 I try to Build My Own wiggeling, Cat Ears

I wrote the code for the resbery pi pico, it should also work for all other micopython devbords, its really simple 

You need 

	1x devbord (I use a Resbery pi pico)
	1/2x Servo motors (0-180)
	1x external button (I use an old pc power switch)
	a vew jumper cables 

Installation 

	save the [servo.py] and [main.py] on your devbord 
	conect the button (for resbery pi pico at PIN 14:GND)
	and the servo (for resbery pi pico (	Power/VCC color Red PIN5V (VBUS) 	GND Black, or brown GND 	Signal Yellow, orange, or white	GPIO 0 (or any other PWM Pin))
	now you can start
